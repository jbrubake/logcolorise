A nice (pretty?) log file coloriser.

Purpose:

To make normal (ugly, unreadable) log files generated by syslogd
look half-decent (even nice?) and easy to parse visually.  It may
be an idea to run this on the logs before they are rotated by
logrotate.  This way when you go back over your logs, they'll be
colorised for you.

Usage:

cat /var/log/messages | logcolorise.pl
or
tail -f /var/log/messages | logcolorise.pl
or
logcolorise.pl /var/log/messages

I'm currently using it as a constant status display on virtual terminals with the following:

9:234:respawn:/usr/bin/tail -f /var/log/messages | /usr/local/bin/logcolorize.pl > /dev/tty9
10:234:respawn:/usr/bin/tail -f /var/log/secure | /usr/local/bin/logcolorize.pl > /dev/tty10

(This requires, however, that you do a "killall tail" when you rotate logs, etc.)

Contributed scripts:

The contrib directory contains sample scripts I use or that have been submitted by users.

Notes:

Any file names will work as logcolorise works with STDIN and STDOUT.
To use 'more' on the results of logcolorise, use the -f switch:
	cat /var/log/messages | logcolorise | more -f

Modifications:

If you make any modifications, or use this script in some interesting
fashion, please E-mail me at <mikebabcock@pobox.com> so I can get some
idea of how it's being accepted and/or used "in the community" if you will.

Note that release 1.0.2 has been mostly the work of the dozen or more
people who E-mailed me wonderful suggestions and patches for the
program.  Thank-you all.

(From Freshmeat note by Mathieu Arnold:)
I'm used to have my syslog show on my tty12, and when I discovered logcolorise, I wanted to have my tty12 colorised :) so here is what I did : 
   I made a : 
   mkfifo /dev/logcolorise 
   I replaced the syslog.conf line 
   *.info;mail.*;authpriv.*;kern.*;local1.* |/dev/tty12 
   with : 
   *.info;mail.*;authpriv.*;kern.*;local1.* |/dev/logcolorise 
   and i added to my syslog startup script : 
   /usr/local/bin/logcolorise.pl /dev/logcolorise > /dev/tty12 & 

   and here was my tty12 colorised :)
