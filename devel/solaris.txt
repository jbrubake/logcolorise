Subject: logcolorise.pl & Solaris additions

I like your script a lot. I'm an admin for a number of different
UNIX platforms, so maybe I can provide some helpful info. Can you add
some extra words and phrases to highlight? Also, can you version your
download file so that people can tell what version they're getting?

NOTE: If I get some time, I'll try to hack some more in and give you
back a modified script, but just thought I'd throw these out to start
with.

here's some sample messages entries from  SPARC SOLARIS and what I'd
like to be highlighted:


Sun GBIC RESETS

     --- "Fibre Channel is OFFLINE" and "Fibre Channel Loop is ONLINE"
should be highlited. These are *CRITICAL*!
